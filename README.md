# Software-Defect-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
In SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle) One of the major challenge in IT Industry is to detect Bugs/Defects in Software Modules Due to this Company performs various testing technique such as Beta Testing by taking End User feedback and based upon it it updates the Software Modules, But Still it is not able to eliminate defect properly that leads to software remains buggy. So with the help of Machine Learning technique we can detect whether a software contains Bug or not. Task -

1.Initial Phase Perform Data Preprocessing Part to convert the raw dataset into optimize dataset by performing Feature Selection, Correlation Matrix with Heatmap and Performed Handing Imbalance of dataset.
2.Used Random Forest and XG Boost Machine learning Algorithms by Performing Hyper Parameter Tuning to Increase the efficiency of Defect Prediction.
